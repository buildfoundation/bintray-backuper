## Reasons to Back up Repositories from Bintray

- Migration to another artifact hosting service
- Protection from [Bintray downtimes](https://status.bintray.com)
- Prevention of data loss in case Bintray loses it

Backups, aka "better safe than sorry"!

## Key Features

- Parallel downloads
- Parallel metadata resolution
- Download is skipped if checksum of local file matches expected one from Bintray metadata
- Checksum is verified for freshly downloaded file to prevent data corruption
- Timeouts, threads and buffers can be configured for better performance
